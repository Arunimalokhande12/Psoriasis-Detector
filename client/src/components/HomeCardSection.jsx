            Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells, causing scaling and inflammation. It typically appears as red patches covered with silvery scales and may occur on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back.

            Although the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Triggers can include infections, stress, cold weather, and certain medications.

            Early diagnosis and treatment are essential in managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Treatments range from topical creams and phototherapy to systemic medications and biologics, tailored to each individual’s condition and needs.
